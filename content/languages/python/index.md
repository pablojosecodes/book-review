title: Python3.12
---
> Note: this page is heavily in construction

Welcome to my notes on `Python`. Iâ€™ve used Python for many, many purposes over the years, but never took the time to go through the actual documentation, in full. Imagine all the potential cool features I might be missing out on!

This page is the result of that effort, to catch up with Python3.12 and ensure that I can write the most effiicent, high quality Python code. For now, my main reference text is the [Python3.12 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.12/index.html) itself.

## things you can do with this

If you're anything like me, you'd love to learn this for no reason- but it's good to know what skills you can expect to learn with this content.

With the material in these pages you should be able to 
- Critcize any piece of Typescript code you see on the internet for not adhering to proper design principles.
- Migrate your organization from Javascript to Typescript effectively and unlock the benefits it provides.

## the content

I'd recommend reading in order of the files, but I've tried to make the information as atomic as possible- enjoy!
