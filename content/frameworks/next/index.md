Welcome to my notes on `NextJS`.
## the why and what

Before we dive into `NextJS`, let's understand why you should care about it in the first place.

`NextJS` is a React-based framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React applications.

It's useful for:
- Enhancing performance and user experience through server-side rendering and static site generation.
- Simplifying the development of complex applications with built-in routing and page-based structure.
- Improving SEO for React applications, thanks to server-side rendering and faster load times.
