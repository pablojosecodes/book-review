Hey friend,

I hope you’re doing well!

If you’re getting this email it’s because I consider you one of my closest friends and/or I want to keep you posted on what’s going on in my life. I send this email out once a quarter to keep you all up to date on my going–ons, since I’m a notoriously slow texter and don’t use social media.

### What’s been going on with me?

In case you didn’t know, I’m wrapping up a Master’s in AI in Madrid. 

I just got back from London where I checked out the tech scene and built some hardware projects- although I mostly just got coffee with engineers and VCs.

## The big news!

I’m heading back to SF a week from today! If you’re in the Bay, I would absolutely love to catch up.

## My Quarterly Forecast

I think it’d be fun and constructive to structure part of this quarterly update as a corporation would: providing some more abstract version of profit and loss statements- as well as elucidate on projections missed / hit. Especially considering these emails will likely be the highest fidelity record of my goals/state of mind at various points in my early adult life.

So here are my quarterly projections (to be assesed by the start of Q2, in May)
