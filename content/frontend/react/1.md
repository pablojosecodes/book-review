# Responding to events
Event handlers: functions triggered in response to user interactions
- Built-in components’s like `<button>` only support built-in browser-event slike `onclick`
- You can build your own event handlers
- Name typically begins with “handle”


Adding event handler
- Pass as prop
- Can also define inline with arrow function `onclick={() => {function();}}`

Pitfall: Functions passed to event handlers must be passed, not called
- ie `<button onClick={handleClick}>`

Props
- You can pass prop as the event handler

Naming event handler props
- Convention: start with on

Note: make sure to use appropriate HTML tags for event handlers

Event propagation
- Events bubble up the tree- one by one
- Except for `onScroll`- only works on JSX tag its attached to

Stopping propagation
- You can call `e.stopPropagation();` to stop event propagation from going further
- Note: if yu really need to catch all events on child elements, even if they stopped propagation (ie. for logging every click for analytics),  you can use `Capture` at end of the event name (ie. `onClickCapture`)
	- Thus, each event propagates in 3 phases
		- Travels downwards, calling all `onClickCapture` handleres
		- Runs clicked element’s `onClick` handler
		- Travels up, calling all `onClick` handlers


Preventing default behavior
- Use `e.preventDefault()` to prevent browser default behavior


# State

Use `useState` to remember things
- Is a hook- special function which lets component use React features

Naive state: Just changing variables- doesn’t work
- Local varaibles don’t persist between renders
- Changes to local variables won’t trigger renders
`useState` fixes both
- State variable: retains data between data with a state variable
- State setter function: updates variable and triggers React to render component again

Convention
- `const [property, setProperty] = useState(initialProperty)`

Rule: only call hooks at the top level
- React relies on stable call order on every render of the same component to know which state is which

State is private + independent for each component

# Render and Commit
Before components are displayed on the screen, they must be rendered by React

Requesting / serving UI has 3 steps
1. Triggering render (delivering order to kitchen)
2. Rendering component (preparing order in the kitchen)
3. Comitting to the DOM (placing order on the table)


**1. Triggering a render**
Happens for two reasons
1. Initial render: when app starts
2. Re-render: When state updates
	1. Updating state automatically queues a render

**2. React Renders your components**
React figures out what to display on the screen by calling your components

On initial render- react calls root component
Subsequent render- calls function component whose state update triggered render
- If has children, recursive rendering of component’s children

**3. React Commits changes to the DOM**
After rendering, the actual modifying of the DOM

Initial render- uses `appendChild()` DOM API to put all DOM nodes it has on screen

Re-renders: minmial necessary operations (calculated while rendering) to make DOM match the latest rendering output
- Only changes DOM nodes if difference between renders


# State as a Snapshot
Think of state as a snapshot
- Updating state doesn’t change the state varibale you have, but triggers a rerender
- Thus, if you change state then immediately log, the state will seem the same


Remember: Setting state triggers a re-render

Rendering takes a snapshot in time, when React re-renders a component
1. React calls your function again
2. Your function returns a new JSX snapshot
3. React then updates the screen to match the snapshot your function returned

State lives in React itself

Setting state only changes it for the next render (thus, doing `setNumber(number+1)` 10 times is the same as once)

Event handlers created in the past have state values from the render inw hich they were created
# Queueing a Series of State Updates
Sometims ou want to perform multiple operations in state before queueing the next render


React batches state updates
- Can’t just call `setState(state+1)` 10 times in a row (would be the same as once)
- **Batching** React waits until all code in event handlers has run before processing your state updates (viz. waiter taking your order)

Updating same state multiple times
- If you needed to update variable multiple times before newxt render, you can pass an `updater` function instead
	- `setNumber(n => n + 1)`
- React still goes through the state queue, but now it doesn’t rely on old state

# Updating Objects in State

You can store any Javscript value in state including objects
- Treat objects as immutable- numbers numbres, booleans, strings
Basically- **treat state as read-only** 

Spread syntax
- ie. `setPerson({...person, firstname: e.target.value});`
- Also, you can use braces inside object definition to specify property with dynamic name
	- ie. `setPerson({...person, [e.target.name]: e.target.value});`
- Note: spread syntax is shallow

Updating a nested object
- ie. `setPerson({...person, artwork: {...person.artwork, city: 'New Delhi'}});`
- Side note: objets aren’t actualy nested 
	- “nested objects” are objects which point to other objects
- Shortcut- **Immer**
	- Lets nested update look more like `updatePerson(draft => {draft.artwork.city = 'Lagos';})`

# Updating Arrays in State
Treat arrays (like objects) as read-only!
- Need to pass a new array in state setting function
- Note: slice vs splice
	- `splice`- mutate array
	- `slice` - copy array or part of it

Add to array (spread)
- `setArtists([...artists, {id: nextId++, name: name}]);`
Removing from array (filter)
- `setArtists(artists.filter(a => a.id !== artist.id));`
Changing all or some elements (map)
```typescript

const nextShapes = shapes.map(shape => {
  if (shape.type === 'square') {
	// No change
	return shape;
  } else {
	// Return a new circle 50px below
	return {
	  ...shape,
	  y: shape.y + 50,
	};
  }
});
setShapes(nextShapes);

```

Replacing items in array (map)
Inserting into an array (spread and slice())
```typescript
    const nextArtists = [
      // Items before the insertion point:
      ...artists.slice(0, insertAt),
      // New item:
      { id: nextId++, name: name },
      // Items after the insertion point:
      ...artists.slice(insertAt)
    ];
    setArtists(nextArtists);
```

Other more complicated changes
- Can always just `const newArray = [...oldarray];`and then make the changes
Updating objects inside arrays
- Need to create copies from teh point where you want to update, and all the way up to the top lvel

In general, ony mutate objects you have just created

Using Immer:
- Makes it easy to update nested arrays without mutation
