`**Note: this section is under construction**`

Welcome to my notes on `React`. I (like many full-stack engineers) have been using React for a **very** long time (by my standards for long); its compositional tree-like structure makes intuitive sense, and I've always appreciated its helpful community, a side effect of its widespread adoption. 

However, most of my learning of React has been on a need-to-know basis (for example, needing to cache api calls and thus conssulting the documentation to pick up that skill). This isn't necessarily a bad approach to master a topic, but I've recently decided to try being more of a "read-the-full-manual-a-couple-times" kind of guy. And so, I decided to learn all the principles of React from scratch.

After some exploration, I couldn't find any book nearly as well-written or up to date as [the official documentation itself](https://react.dev/learn), so I used it as my main text! 

This section is a (hopefully) well put together collection of my reference notes after that deep dive.

## Why learn react?

Before we dive into `React`, let's understand why you should care about it in the first place. Itâ€™s a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for web applications, and is useful for
- Creating dynamic and interactive web applications with efficient UI updates and rendering.
- Building large-scale applications with reusable components and efficient data management.

## What can you do with this information?

If you're anything like me, you'd love to learn this for no reason - but it's good to know what skills you can expect to learn with this content.

With the materials in these pages, you should be able to build:
- Any fully reactive Single Page Application (SPA) that dynamically updates the UI without reloading the page.
- Components that are reusable across different parts of your application or even in different projects.
- Complex applications with state management, using tools like Redux or React's own Context API.
- Integration with APIs and external data sources to fetch, display, and manage data.
- Modern web applications with features like routing, lazy loading, and asynchronous data handling.

## Dive into the content!

I'd recommend reading in order of the TOC, but I've tried to make the information as atomic as possible- enjoy!
