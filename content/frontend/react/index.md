`**Note: this section is under construction**`

Welcome to my notes on `React`. I (like many full-stack engineers) have been using React for a **very** long time (by my standards for long); it's compositional tree-like structure makes intuitive sense, and I've always appreciated the robust community that it's spurred. 

However, most of my knowledge of React has been on a need-to-know basis (for example, checking out the documentation for specific tasks like needing to be able to cache api calls). This isn't necessarily a bad approach to master a topic, but I've recently decided to be more of a "read-the-full-manual" kind of guy. And so, I decided to learn all the principles of React from scratch.

After some exploration, I couldn't find any book nearly as well-written or up to date as [the official documentation itself](https://react.dev/learn), so I used it as my main text! 

## the why and what

Before we dive into `React`, let's understand why you should care about it in the first place.

`React` is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for web applications.

It's useful for:
- Creating dynamic and interactive web applications with efficient UI updates and rendering.
- Building large-scale applications with reusable components and efficient data management.
- Enhancing the user experience with fast and responsive interfaces.

## things you can do with this

If you're anything like me, you'd love to learn this for no reason - but it's good to know what skills you can expect to learn with this content.

With the materials in these pages, you should be able to build:
- Any fully reactive Single Page Application (SPA) that dynamically updates the UI without reloading the page.
- Components that are reusable across different parts of your application or even in different projects.
- Complex applications with state management, using tools like Redux or React's own Context API.
- Integration with APIs and external data sources to fetch, display, and manage data.
- Modern web applications with features like routing, lazy loading, and asynchronous data handling.

I've done almost all my consulting, full-time work, web-app projects, and products in React.

## the content

I'd recommend reading in order of the files, but I've tried to make the information as atomic as possible- enjoy!
