Welcome to my notes on `Natural Language Processing`.

## the why and what

Before we dive into `Natural Language Processing`, let's understand why you should care about it in the first place.

`Natural Language Processing` is a fascinating intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. It's about teaching computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a valuable and meaningful way.

It's useful for 
- Building conversational interfaces
- Analyzing/generating many varieties of text
- Understanding linguistics from a new perspective

## things you can do with this

If you're anything like me, you'd love to learn this for no reason- but it's good to know what skills you can expect to learn with this content.

With the material in these pages, you should be able to build
- Sophisticated chatbots that can understand and respond to human queries
- Advanced text analysis tools that can extract sentiment, categorize content, and detect key topics
- Understand how consumer applications like ChatGPT were built
## the content

I've divided the content into the following sections

1. [[Linguistics of Language Models]]: understanding the fundamental building blocks of language
	- [[Word Vectors]]: how do we represent words?
	- [[Dependency Parsing]]: analyzing the dependency structure of language
	- [[Constituency Parsing]]: Analyzing the hierarchical structure of sentences into nested syntactic components
	- [[Coreference Resolution]]: 
	- [[ml/nlp/Linguistics/Linguistics of Language Models|Linguistics of Language Models]]: What do language models know about linguistics? How can we find out?
1. [[ml/nlp/index 1|Architectures]]: which architectures are most useful for nlp tasks?
	- [[Language Models]]: recurrent models like LSTMs, GRU, etc.
	- [[ConvNets + TRNNs]]
	- [[Attention + Transformer]]: How can we apply attention and the transformer architecture to natural language tasks?
	- [[Pretraining]]: everything youâ€™ve ever wanted to know about pretraining language models
2. [[ml/nlp/Applications/index|Applications]]: what can we do with NLP? how should we approach these problems?
	- [[Natural Language Generation]]:
	- [[Question Answering]]: 
	- [[Code Generation]]: 
	- [[Multimodal]]: some fun exploration into multimodal applications
