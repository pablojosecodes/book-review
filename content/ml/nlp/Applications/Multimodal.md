# Early Models
Key question: How to align langauge and vision model?


Get some similarity metric and try to align the output vectors of 
- Skip gram language model
- Traditional visual model

Multimodal distributional semantics
- **Bag of visual words**: 
	- Take picture
	- Use algo (like SIFT) to find key points
	- Get feature descriptor for each key point
	- Cluster the feature descriptors with k means
	- Count how often feature descriptor occurs (ie. get the bag of words for the descriptors)
	- Concat visual word vector with text word vector 
	- Apply SVD to fuse information
- **Neural version**: applying deep learning to this idea
	- Concatenate features from convnets and word embeddings
	- Or- try to do skip gram prediction onto visual feature

# Where to next?
- One foundation model will rule them all
	- Parameters will be shared in interesting ways
	- modality-agnostic foundation models- read + generate multi-modally
	- Automatic aligment from unpaired unimodal data will become a big topic
- Multimodal scaling laws
	- We will investigate tradeoffs
- Multi-Modal RAG
	- Query encoder: will be multimodal
	- Document index: will be multimodal
	- Generator: will be multimodal
- Beter evals + benchmarking
