**Basic Classifiers**
- KNN classifier
- SVM classifier
- Softmax classifier
- 2 layer nn classifier

**CNN Layers + Implementations**
- FC networks, arbitrary depth + optimize with several popular update rules
- Batchnorm
- Dropout
- Some CNN layers
- Practice PyTorch + train CNN of own design on CIFAR-10
- Salience Maps with pretrained models

**Sequential + Generative Model**
- Vanilla RNN for image captioning
- LSTM for image captioning
- GAN + improve classifier performance

**Attention**
- Transformer for image captioning
- Use self-supervised pretraining for better performance
