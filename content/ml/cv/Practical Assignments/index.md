The best way to internalize the knowledge on these pages is to implement it. What does this mean?
- For architectures: build them from scratch.
- For training paradigms: test out different methods and get an intuitive feel for the results.
- For theorems/ generally accepted rules: derive them from scratch

With that in mind, here are implementations Iâ€™d recommend you take on to truly cement the leranings from this section on [[ml/cv/index|Computer Vision]].

Basic Classifiers- Use numpy to build classes and training loops (including gradient descent)
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine Classsifier
- Softmax Classifer
- Multilayer Neural Network

Convolutional architectures
- Multilyaer Fuly Connected Networks
