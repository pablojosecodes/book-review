title: Computer Vision

Welcome to my notes on `computer vision`.

Content I used to learn this material: [Stanford’s CS231N (2023)](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), [relevant lectures from efficientml.ai (2023)](https://efficientml.ai/), and [UMichs’s EECS 498 (2022)](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/WI2022/)




## the content

I'd recommend reading in order of the files, but I've tried to make the information as atomic as possible- enjoy!

In order to udnerstand the key architectures that underpine computer vision, I would advise you to review the fundamental ML section.

[[Applications]]
1. [[Semantic Segmentation]]
2. [[Object Detection]] 
3. [[Instance Segmentation]] 
4. [[3D]]
5. [[Video Understanding]]
6. [[Visualization and understanding]]
7. [[Self-Supervised Learning]]
8. [[Generative Models]]
