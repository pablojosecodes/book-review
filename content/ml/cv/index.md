title: Computer Vision
---
Welcome to my notes on `computer vision`.

Content I used to learn this material: [Stanford’s CS231N (2023)](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), [relevant lectures from efficientml.ai (2023)](https://efficientml.ai/), and [UMichs’s EECS 498 (2022)](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/WI2022/)

## the why and what

Before we dive into `computer vision`, let's understand why you should care about it in the first place.
