2 tracks
- Apply CV model to problem of interest
	- Requirements
		- Good data preparation
		- Approprioate loss functios
		- Details of training
		- Cross validation
		- Good test set eval 
		- Model comparisons. 
	- Examples
		- [DCNN play go](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3409)
		- [Atari- Deep RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602)
	- Note- Convnets can run in real time on phones- mobile app could be cool
- Build new model or variant and apply to tackle vision tasks
