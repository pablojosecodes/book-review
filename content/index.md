title: Welcome to Pablo's Reference Notes
---
> Quick note: this is all an active work in progress! Iâ€™ve only started putting notes here towards the end of January 2024, so this is all (as to be expected) a bit unorganized. It should be more legible / curated by the end of February

Welcome to the website where I store my reference notes for some books I've read / topics I'm learning about. 

My typical process is as follows: read book -> write notes -> apply -> synthesize reference notes

If you're using any of these notes as reference material (sweet!), then do consider implementing relevant projects- that's the best way to cement your learnings. I've included relevant projects I've done as well as other sample projects/use cases for each of these categories.

I also feel the need to note that absolutey note of the content on this website was generated with the use of a large language model.
