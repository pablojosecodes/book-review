title: Welcome to Pablo's Book Notes
---

Welcome to the website where I store my reference notes for some books I've read / topics I'm learning about. 

My typical process is as follows: read book -> write notes -> apply -> synthesize reference notes

If you're using any of these notes as reference material (sweet!), then do consider implementing relevant projects- that's the best way to cement your learnings. I've included relevant projects I've done as well as other sample projects/use cases for each of these categories.
