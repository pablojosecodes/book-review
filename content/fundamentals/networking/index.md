`**Note: this section is under construction**`

Welcome to my notes on `networking`. I first became interested in this topic when I was building a collaborative WYSIWYG musical editor and realized… I didn’t even know where to start with the “collaborative” piece.

The book I used to learn this topic was [High-Performance Browser Networking by Ilya Grigorik](https://hpbn.co/)

## the why and what

Before we dive into `networking`, let's understand why you should care about it in the first place.

`Networking` is a critical aspect of computer science that involves the exchange of data and resources between computers over a shared or public network.

It's useful for:
- Establishing and maintaining reliable and efficient communication channels between devices.
- Enhancing the performance and scalability of web applications and services.
- Securing data transfer and access across networks.

## things you can do with this

If you're anything like me, you'd love to learn this for no reason - but it's good to know what skills you can expect to learn with this content.

With the material in these pages, you should be able to build:
1. Robust network infrastructures that support efficient data transmission.
2. Secure and scalable web applications that leverage modern networking protocols.
3. Optimization strategies for improving website performance and user experience.

Here's some stuff I've directly used this content to build

I'd recommend reading in order of the files, but I've tried to make the information as atomic as possible- enjoy!
