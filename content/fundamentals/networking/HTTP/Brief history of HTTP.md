HTTP: one of most widely addopted application protocols on the internet
- Common language bewteen clients and servers


Letâ€™s take a historical tour of the evoution of the HTTP protocol

# HTTP 0.9: one-line protocol

Original proposal: simplicity

Simple prototype with subset of proposed functionality

 General architecture
 - Client request: single ASCII character string
 - Client request: terminated by carriage return (CLRF)
 - Server response: ASCII character stream
 - Server response: HTML
 - Connection terminated afte document transfer is complete

But really- it just enables extremely smple Telnet ffriendly protocol

- Request- single line (e.g. GET and path)
- Response- single hypertext document


Recap of the features
- Client server, request-response protocol
- ASCII protocol, running over TCP/IP link
- Design to transfer HTML
- Connected between sever / client closed after every request
