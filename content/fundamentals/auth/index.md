`**Note: this section is under construction**`

Welcome to my notes on `auth`.  Funnily enough, I first decided to dive into this topic after checking out a startup called [Anon](https://www.anon.com). They’re building an SDK which lets developers control user’s identities across the internet. I loved the idea, but didn’t have enough of the background information to judge its place in the broader ecosystem. That bothred me, so I decided ot learn `auth`

The book I used to learn this topic was [Solving Identity Management in Modern Applications by Yvonne Wilson and Abhishek Hingnik](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/solving-identity-management/9781484250952/).

## the why and what

Before we dive into `auth`, let's understand why you should care about it in the first place.

`auth` is a stand-in term for authentication (who is this user) and authorization (what can this user do)?

It's useful for virtually everythig across the web, including
- APIs
- Webapp systems

## things you can do with this


With the material in these pages you should be able to
- Understand the modern auth landscape
- Understand the tradeoffs of different approches when implementing your own auth schemes

Here's some stuff I've directly used this content to build
