title: Stream Processing
---
We iscussed batch processing and saw how the output is a form of *derived data*

But, we made a big assumption- that hte input is bounded

In reality- data is unbounded very often- can gradually arrive

Stream processing
- tream: data incrementally made available
- Event stream: Unbounded incrementally processed counterpart to the batch data from the last chapter
