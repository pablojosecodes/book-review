title: Designing Data Intensive Applications

`**Note: this section is under construction**`

Welcome to my notes on the book `Designing Data Intensive Applications`. DDIA is a classic software engineering book and considered a must-read by many engineers.

I used this book to learn a bit more about data systems in real world, large scale applications.

## the why and what

What is `Designing Data Intensive Applications`? 
- It’s a book on designing data intensive applications
- Just kidding. 
- Well yet, but
- More specifically, it’s a very broad book on the fundamental principles of system design (with many [reference links](https://github.com/ept/ddia-references) if you want to go deeper)

Why should we care about this book’s content on system design / data intensive applications?
- It’s good to know how data systems work at a fundamental level

It's useful for 
- Architecting services
- Selecting data systems
- Deeply understanding architectures you work with on a day to day basis

## things you can do with this

The material from this reference section will be essential for
- Understanding data systems
- Picking and choosing between different design approaches

# TOC

I'd recommend reading in order of the files, but I've tried to make the information as atomic as possible- enjoy!
