`**Note: this section is under construction**`

Welcome to my notes on `SQL`.  I felt I had a pretty good grasp on SQL (I  taught some sessions at my university club on SQL), but exploring it more rigorously was very fruitful.  

The book I used to learn this topic was [Learning SQL: Generate, Manipulate, and Retrieve Data](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1492057614/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1492057614&linkCode=as2&tag=snirsuggestin-20&linkId=549fcae1e30ab9fc60c5520189ea25d5).

## the why and what

Before we dive into `SQL`, let's understand why you should care about it in the first place.

`SQL` is a powerful programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases.

It's useful for:
- Efficiently querying and retrieving data from large databases.
- Managing and updating database structures and records.
- Analyzing and interpreting complex data sets to aid in decision-making processes.

## things you can do with this

If you're anything like me, you'd love to learn this for no reason- but it's good to know what skills you can expect to learn with this content.

With the maerial in these pages you should be able to build
1. Robust databases tailored to specific needs or projects.
2. Complex queries for data analysis, including filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.
3. Reports and visualizations that make data insights accessible and actionable.
4. Automated data processing scripts to enhance efficiency and accuracy.
5. Data-driven strategies and solutions to real-world problems.

## the content

I'd recommend reading in order of the files, but I've tried to make the information as atomic as possible- enjoy!
